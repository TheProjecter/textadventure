TAC is a small Android application that allows you to design simple explore-and-collect adventures in text mode. TAC is reminiscent of old text-based adventure game engines such as [Adventureland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventureland_%28computer_game%29) from Scott Adams.

_Text Adventure Creator_ allows you to do the following:

  * Design adventure maps using a simple text editor
  * Download the map to your phone
  * Play the map on your phone using the touch screen
